# Lessons Learned Protocol

> Version: 1.0.0

## Context 📚
- Serves as critical knowledge base for development insights
- Captures solutions and best practices
- Documents issues and their resolutions
- Maintains project-wide learning history

## Requirements 📋

### Entry Format
Single-line comprehensive format:
```markdown
[v1.0.0-LL001] Category: Issue → Solution → Impact
```

### Version Format
- Format: v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-LL{sequential_number}
  - major: Breaking changes
  - minor: New features/significant updates
  - patch: Bug fixes/minor updates
  - LL: Lessons Learned prefix
  - sequential_number: Unique 3-digit identifier (001-999)

## Examples 💡

### ✅ Good Lesson Entry
```markdown
[v1.0.0-LL001] Component Error: TextInput props incompatible with DatePicker causing type errors during component composition → Implemented strict prop type validation and interface checks before component extension → Critical for preventing runtime type mismatches and ensuring component reusability
```

### ❌ Invalid Lesson Entry
```markdown
Bug: Button not working
Fixed it by changing the code
[No version ID ❌]
[No category ❌]
[No impact assessment ❌]
```

## ⚠️ Critical Rules
- ALWAYS include version ID, category, and impact
- NEVER delete or modify existing entries
- MAINTAIN single-line format for all entries
- INCLUDE clear problem → solution → impact chain
- CATEGORIZE entries appropriately
- INCREMENT version numbers appropriately based on change type
