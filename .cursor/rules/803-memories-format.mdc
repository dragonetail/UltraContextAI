# Memory Format Rules

> Version: 4.0.0

## Context
*This memories file maintains a chronological record of project activities and development decisions. Each entry requires a comprehensive single-line description with full context. It has a title, date, and a very long description of the interaction, changes, and decisions made. Create @memories2.md at 1000 lines with maintained cross-references. Never delete past entries.*

## Memory Entry Format

### Content Guidelines
1. Description Format:
   - Complete interaction context

## Examples

### ✅ Good Entries
```markdown
### **Layer Manager Implementation (March 19, 2025)**
- The development team began implementing a centralized Layer Manager to handle all map layer logic, focusing on basin display, township selection, and section viewing with proper z-index, visibility, and zoom control, while ensuring proper integration with existing components and maintaining consistent state management throughout the application.

### **Profile Management Implementation (March 19, 2025)**
- The development team successfully implemented Phase 2 of Profile Management by adding new columns to the profiles table (first_name, last_name, theme_preference), creating sophisticated profile management components with proper form validation, and implementing comprehensive personal information and security features that support real-time updates while maintaining data integrity and user privacy.
```

### ❌ Bad Entries
```markdown
### **Layer Manager**
- Added new layer manager
[Too vague, missing context and details ❌]

### **Profile Management**
- Updated profile management with new features and columns
[Lacks specific details about changes and implementation ❌]
```
